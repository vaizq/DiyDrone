# DiyDrone
Completely homemade drone from cheap ebay parts.
<h2>Current state of the project</h2>

<p>
Idea is to make drone from general parts, as cheaply as possible.
I will be using atmel168 as brains, for both drone and for controller.
Some attiny would be cheaper, but 168 is most popular and has a lot of pins for motors. So it's currently my choce.

<h2>Code</h2>
<p>Code for controller and drone is in src.
I try to keep everything simple...
